# Computer_Graphics_Exps

This repository contains various computer graphics experiments implemented in C using the Turbo C graphics library. Each program demonstrates a specific algorithm or visual representation useful for understanding computer graphics fundamentals.

## Prerequisites

- Turbo C/C++ or compatible DOSBox setup
- Graphics library path: `C:\\TURBOC3\\BGI` (used in all programs)

## Experiments Included

### ðŸ”¹ Experiment  - **DDA Line Drawing Algorithm**
**File:** `DDA line.docx`  
Implements the Digital Differential Analyzer (DDA) algorithm to draw a line between two user-defined points.

### ðŸ”¹ Experiment  - **Missing Content**
**File:** `exp 8-1.pdf`  
Note: This file appears to be incomplete with no visible code or output.

### ðŸ”¹ Experiment  - **Line Clipping Algorithm**
**File:** `exp 12.docx`  
Implements a basic version of the Cohen-Sutherland line clipping algorithm. It clips a line segment within a rectangular window.

### ðŸ”¹ Experiment  - **Hilbert Curve (Fractal)**
**File:** `exp 15.pdf`  
Draws a space-filling Hilbert Curve using recursion to visualize fractal curves.

### ðŸ”¹ Experiment  - **Koch Curve (Fractal)**
**File:** `exp 16-1.pdf`  
Recursive generation of a Koch snowflake-like curve by subdividing line segments and replacing them with zigzag segments.

### ðŸ”¹ Arrow Drawing
**File:** `arrow.docx`  
Creates a simple 2D arrow shape using multiple line segments.

### ðŸ”¹ Drawing 6 Objects
**File:** `6 objects.docx`  
Contains three different graphics programs:
- A face with eyes and mouth
- A house with roof and walls
- A pattern made using multiple arcs

## How to Run

1. Open Turbo C/C++.
2. Create a new file or copy-paste the code from the `.docx` or `.pdf` file into a new source file.
3. Make sure the graphics library path is correctly set (`C:\\TURBOC3\\BGI`).
4. Compile and run the program.

---

## Notes

- Always initialize the graphics driver properly with `initgraph()`.
- Ensure the path to `BGI` is correctly referenced based on your Turbo C installation.
- Programs must be executed in DOSBox or compatible 16-bit environments to visualize output.
